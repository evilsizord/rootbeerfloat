Root Beer Float
================

Root Beer Float is a dark Notepad++ theme, based on the Obsidian theme.

Styles are defined for the web languages I usually work with: PHP, XML, HTML, CSS, SQL, Javascript. Other languages will just default to Obsidian styles.

To install, simply place the XML file into your Notepad++ installation folder, in the "themes" directory. Usually this will be something like c:\Program Files\Notepad++\themes\.
